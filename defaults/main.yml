logrotate_global:
  # frequency
  #  - hourly
  #    Log files are rotated every hour.
  #    Note that usually logrotate is configured to be run by cron daily.
  #    You have to change this configuration and run logrotate hourly to be able
  #    to really rotate logs hourly.
  #  - daily
  #    Log files are rotated every day.
  #  - weekly
  #    Log  files are rotated once each weekday,
  #    or if the date is advanced by at least 7 days since the last rotation (while ignoring the exact time).
  #    The weekday interpretation is following:
  #      0 means Sunday,
  #      1 means Monday,
  #      ...,
  #      6 means Saturday;
  #    the special value 7 means each 7 days, irrespectively of weekday.
  #    Defaults to 0 if the weekday argument is omitted.
  #  - monthly
  #    Log files are rotated the first time logrotate is run in a month (this is normally on the first day of the month).
  #  - yearly
  #    Log files are rotated if the current year is not the same as the last rotation.
  #
  rotate_log: weekly
  # restrict maximum size of log files
  # Log files are rotated only if they grow bigger than size bytes.
  # If size is followed by k, the size is assumed to be in kilobytes.
  # If the M is used, the size is in megabytes, and if G is used, the size is in gigabytes.
  # So size 100, size 100k, size 100M and size 100G are all valid.
  # This option is mutually exclusive with the time interval options,
  # and it causes log files to be rotated without regard for the last rotation time,
  # if specified after the time criteria (the last specified option takes the precedence).

  # Log files are rotated count times before being removed or mailed to the address specified in a mail directive.
  # If count is 0, old versions are removed rather than rotated.
  # If count is -1, old logs are not removed at all, except they are affected by maxage
  # (use with caution, may waste performance and disk space).
